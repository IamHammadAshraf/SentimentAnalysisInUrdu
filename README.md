Sentiment Analysis in Urdu ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° | NLP & Machine Learning
This project focuses on sentiment analysis in the Urdu language using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It preprocesses Urdu text, extracts features, and classifies sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Key Features
âœ… Text Preprocessing â€“ Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming
âœ… Feature Extraction â€“ TF-IDF, Bag of Words
âœ… Machine Learning Models â€“ Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SVM
âœ… Performance Evaluation â€“ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Technologies Used
ðŸ”¹ Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
ðŸ”¹ NLP: NLTK, UrduHack
ðŸ”¹ Jupyter Notebook for implementation
